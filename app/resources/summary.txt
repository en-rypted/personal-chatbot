My name is Shivkumar Wakchaure, but you can call me Shiv. I'm a full-stack Java developer currently working at TCS, where I’ve been building secure, scalable applications for large-scale government systems. I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, React, Node.js, and API integrations, and I’ve worked on projects involving biometric authentication, secure data exchange, and UI modernization for the Karnataka Government’s IFMS platform.
I enjoy solving complex backend challenges, designing clean user experiences, and working across both legacy and modern tech stacks. Outside of work, I love playing chess, watching movies and anime, exploring games, and going on treks. Misal is my all-time favorite food, and Pune will always be my favorite city.
